SUBTERFUGUE to-do list

Here's a list of things to improve or fix, not really in much of a particular
order.


- finish project web page docs (motivation)

- nicer strace trick
- man page (or whatever)
- makefile improvements?
- out of memory trick
- disk full trick
- timewarp trick
- not doing the right thing if parent has a SIGCHLD handler and kid exits (no
  signal gets sent???)
- handle rapid parent or child death at clone
- implement wait rusage
- handle restarting sleep/nanosleep (sigsuspend?) (probably needs KERNEL PATCH)
- disallow blocking (ignoring?) of SIGTRAP?
- problem: ignored signals still cause syscall intr
- deliver exit signal correctly to parent when it's not SIGCHLD (partially done)
- sigreturn call causes problems?
- need to handle lcall7, personality?
- handle siginfo correctly?
- blocking SIGCONT causes problems?  (doesn't look like it)
- handle bogus args (bad path ptr, etc)
- interactive sandbox trick (Gtk+ interface)
- allow root to run as another user (like strace)
- more elaborate Memory interface
- profile/optimize python (try to continue processes ASAP)
- nice general mapping classes (which map strings to values)
- handle volatile memory problem (which allows evasion)
- option for tricks to ignore some children??
- do early detach of a process we know will die? (like strace)
- paranoia trick (block anything that could steal control)
- implement process attach
- implement ptrace in kids (incl CLONE_PTRACE)
- gdb trick
- any use for separate callbefore and callafter masks?
- callmask kernel patch
- get wait working best effort, for the non-traced-parent case
- trace/replay (a la MEC's qtrace) trick?
- support replacement of a call with multiple calls (rather than just 0 or 1),
  probably using RESTARTNOINTR
- do something smarter about the exec SIGTRAP
- handle SIGCONT or others sent to suspended kid (or prevent)
 (this is a race--we don't want other processes CONTinuing traced kids that
  are currently stopped in a PTRACE report
