This is SUBTERFUGUE.  See 'NEWS' for info on the latest release.

SUBTERFUGUE is a framework for observing and playing with the reality of
software; it's a foundation for building tools to do tracing, sandboxing, and
many other things.  You could think of it as "strace meets expect."

Here's a short (real) "screenshot" which hints at one of its possible uses:

    # sf --trick=SimplePathSandbox:"read=['/'];write=['/dev/tty']" bash
    # id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
    # rm -f /etc/passwd
    write deny (unlink): '/etc/passwd'
    rm: cannot unlink `/etc/passwd': Permission denied

[Translation: Run 'bash' in a sandbox (restricted environment) so that it and
all of the processes it creates can read all files (everything under '/') but
can only write '/dev/tty'.  All system calls that read or write to the
filesystem are checked, and the attempt to unlink '/etc/passwd' is
disallowed.]

Disclaimer: SUBTERFUGUE is still fairly alpha.  If you run it on a system that
matters and something breaks, you get to keep both pieces.  Especially avoid
programs where a loss of state might be disastrous (e.g., fetchmail).

See 'http://subterfugue.org' and the sf(1) man page for more info.
