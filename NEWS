SUBTERFUGUE NEWS - notable changes between versions


Version 0.1.99a ("superstar")

* Fix bug that causes sf to exit prematurely if only kids with parent init
  remain.


Version 0.1.99 ("superstar")

* Added a fix to make SUBTERFUGUE work again with the latest 2.4 kernels.
  Made usage of the "wait channel hack" the default, for vanilla 2.4 users.

* Added two new tricks, NetThrottle and TimeWarp, which you can see in action
  now at the bottom of the screenshots page
  (http://subterfugue.org/screenshot.html).  NetThrottle, in particular, seems
  like it would be handy for everyday use.  (TimeWarp is more of an amusement,
  though it might help you cheat at certain arcade games.  :-)

* Added a polished version of the SUBTERFUGUE motivation document to the web
  site (http://subterfugue.org/motivation.html).  Comments welcome.  It's
  pretty over-the-top.  Does it sound like it was composed in a remote Montana
  cabin?  :-0

* Added a man page for sf(1), based on Pavel Machek's original draft.

* Added an 'install' target and Debianization.  A Debian package will be
  available with this release.  It hasn't been tested much yet, but it's
  probably pretty safe.

* Reorganized the C extension modules.

* Generally dusted off all of the cobwebs.  SUBTERFUGUE lives!


Version 0.1.9 ("pagliacci")

* Added fast (in C) ignored-call loop from Pavel Machek.

* Added '--waitchannelhack', which will allow SUBTERFUGUE to run (albeit
  slowly) with no kernel patch on linux 2.3.99 or later.

* The '--output' flag now accepts a file descriptor number as an argument,
  making it easier to separate SUBTERFUGUE output from that of the traced
  program.

* More bug fixes.


Version 0.1.2 ("georgia")

* Several improvements and new tricks (PathSandbox, NoMunmap, Paranoia, Umask)
  from Pavel Machek.

* Removed dependency on PTRACE_GETPPID.  Added use of PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD;
  the corresponding kernel patch allows backward compatibility with existing
  versions of 'strace'.


Version 0.1.1 ("sanchez")

* First cut at integration of Pavel Machek's patch.  It includes his safe
  scratch area stuff (see scratch.py and ScratchTrick.py), plus several new
  tricks (Arg, Net, NoKill, NoClose123, GoodDisc).

* Enhancement to SimplePathSandbox to support denial of access to certain
  paths.  (also from Pavel)


Version 0.1.0 ("somewhere")

* Optimization (for speed) of process following.  (Following 'emacs -nw' with
  no tricks, for example, is now about 30-40% faster.)

* Improved path canonicalization, from a suggestion by Pavel Kankovsky.

* Bug fixes.


Version 0.0 ("slaughter")

* First public release.

* Pre-alpha quality, but seems to be able to follow Netscape Navigator and JDK
  'appletviewer' under native Linux threads.
