SUBTERFUGUE NEWS - notable changes between versions


Version 0.1.0 ("somewhere")

* Optimization (for speed) of process following.  (Following 'emacs -nw' with
  no tricks, for example, is now about 30-40% faster.)

* Improved path canonicalization, from a suggestion by Pavel Kankovsky.

* Bug fixes.


Version 0.0 ("slaughter")

* First public release.

* Pre-alpha quality, but seems to be able to follow Netscape Navigator and JDK
  'appletviewer' under native Linux threads.
