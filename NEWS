SUBTERFUGUE NEWS - notable changes between versions


Version 0.1.9 ("pagliacci")

* Added fast (in C) ignored-call loop from Pavel Machek.

* Added '--waitchannelhack', which will allow SUBTERFUGUE to run (albeit
  slowly) with no kernel patch on linux 2.3.99 or later.

* The '--output' flag now accepts a file descriptor number as an argument,
  making it easier to separate SUBTERFUGUE output from that of the traced
  program.

* More bug fixes.


Version 0.1.2 ("georgia")

* Several improvements and new tricks (PathSandbox, NoMunmap, Paranoia, Umask)
  from Pavel Machek.

* Removed dependency on PTRACE_GETPPID.  Added use of PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD;
  the corresponding kernel patch allows backward compatibility with existing
  versions of 'strace'.


Version 0.1.1 ("sanchez")

* First cut at integration of Pavel Machek's patch.  It includes his safe
  scratch area stuff (see scratch.py and ScratchTrick.py), plus several new
  tricks (Arg, Net, NoKill, NoClose123, GoodDisc).

* Enhancement to SimplePathSandbox to support denial of access to certain
  paths.  (also from Pavel)


Version 0.1.0 ("somewhere")

* Optimization (for speed) of process following.  (Following 'emacs -nw' with
  no tricks, for example, is now about 30-40% faster.)

* Improved path canonicalization, from a suggestion by Pavel Kankovsky.

* Bug fixes.


Version 0.0 ("slaughter")

* First public release.

* Pre-alpha quality, but seems to be able to follow Netscape Navigator and JDK
  'appletviewer' under native Linux threads.
