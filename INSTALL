SUBTERFUGUE installation

	$Header$


INSTALLATION

1.  Make sure you're running an acceptable kernel.  Vanilla kernels version
    2.3.99-pre1 and later will work, albeit a bit slowly (because they use the
    wait channel hack).  Patches to avoid the wait channel hack or to run on
    earlier 2.3 kernels are available from the SUBTERFUGUE web site.  You also
    need python 1.5.2; newer versions probably also work but haven't yet been
    tested.

2.  Do a 'make'.  If you have problems building the ptrace module, you may
    have to replace 'Makefile.pre.in' from your Python distribution.

3.  Put 'dsf' in your PATH, or just invoke it in place ("./dsf").  ('dsf' is a
    version of 'sf' that lets you run in the development directory, without
    installing.)  Try "dsf -h"; if you get a usage message, you're doing
    pretty good.

4.  You can test dsf by doing something like

	dsf --trick=Trace date

    The output should be reminiscent of strace, something like

	[1993] brk(0) =
	[1993] 		brk() = 134541676
	[1993] open('/etc/ld.so.preload', 0, 1073815588) =
	[1993] 		open() = -2 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
	[1993] open('/etc/ld.so.cache', 0, 1073815588) =
	[1993] 		open() = 3
	[1993] fstat(3, -1073744208) =
	[1993] 		fstat() = 0

5.  To install, say 'make install' as root, and use 'sf' instead of 'dsf'.
