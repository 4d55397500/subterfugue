SUBTERFUGUE installation

	$Header$


(While SUBTERFUGUE is in this beta state, it's assumed that it will be
run directly out of the source directory.)


INSTALLATION

1.  Make sure you're running an acceptable kernel: 2.4.0 with
    --waitchannelhack is okay; if you have anything older or want to get
    rid of --waitchannelhack, download patch fromhttp://subterfugue.org/. 
    You also need python 1.5.2 or newer.

2.  Do a 'make'.  If you have problems building the ptrace module, you may
    have to replace 'Makefile.pre.in' from your Python distribution.

3.  Put 'sf' in your PATH, or just invoke it in place ("./sf").  Try "sf -h";
    if you get a usage message, you're doing pretty good.

4.  You can test sf by doing something like

	sf --trick=Trace date

    The output should be somewhat reminiscent of strace.
