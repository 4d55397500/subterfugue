This is internal documentation for subterfugue, possibly useful if you want to
understand or extend it.  You (hopefully) don't need to know this if you only
want to use it.



process flags - 

- parent : pid of the process' original parent (key absent if parent is not
	   being followed, e.g., init)
- children : list of pids of process' "original" children (i.e., the processes
	     that would be its children if PTRACE weren't being used
- pgid : process group id of this process
- status : ('exited', exitstatus) if the process exited normally
	   ('signaled', term-signal) if the process exited on a signal
	   ('stopped', stop-signal) if the process has stopped on a signal
	   absent if original parent not also being followed
- newchild : if present, temporary scratchpad right after a
	     fork/clone/vfork. The value is a 2-tuple: the pid of the new
	     child's (original) parent, which can vary depending on whether or
	     not CLONE_PARENT was used, and the tag used to mark the new
	     child.
- newchildflags : a dictionary mapping tags of new children to their flags,
		  which will be assigned as each reports
- startup : if present, the process is just starting, or just did an exec, and
	    needs to skip one (redundant) stop
- exiting : if present, the process has entered the _exit system call
- exit_signal : signal that will be sent to parent when this process exits.
		Linux considers a process to be a "clone" iff its exit signal
		is not SIGCHLD.
- annul : if present, a 2-tuple storing state for an annulled call, where the
	  first arg is the syscall result (or 'waitsuspend' for a suspended
	  wait call), and the second arg is the trick that annulled the call
- exectrappending : if present, means that the process just did an exec, and
		    is therefore expecting a SIGTRAP (which gets ignored)
- waiting : if present, means the process is doing a pause to fake a wait, and
	    is the args to that wait call
- waitresult : if present, pid to be returned by wait when it returns
- skiptrap : if present, the next SIGTRAP should be ignored (because we sent
	     it)
- sigreturn : if present, it means this process has begun a sigreturn or
	   rt_sigreturn call (the call name is the value).
- deathnotice : if present, a list of (pid, signal) pairs, where 'pid' is a
	   child that has just died, and 'signal' is the signal that is to be
	   delivered to the parent (i.e., SIGCHLD, unless clone is involved).
