<h2>ArgTrick</h2>
<p>Allows you to do regexp substitution on paths passed to system
calls. This can be used to generate something chroot-like (for
example), or to fake file you can not overwrite.</p>

Examples:
<pre>
--trick=Arg:s1=['^/'];s2=['/strange_chroot_jail']
--trick=Arg:s1=['^/etc/passwd'];s2=['/etc/termcap']
</pre>

<h2>BoxTrick</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>


<h2>CountTrick</h2>
<p>Counts the system calls and signals for each process and reports after
all processes have terminated.</p>


<h2>DelayTrick</h2>
<p>Puts a delay before each system call.  The 'delay' parameter specifies
the delay in seconds (as a float).  The default delay is one second.</p>


<h2>DosTrick</h2>
<p>Tries to prevent DoS attacks.</p>

<p>The parameters 'maxmem'
and 'maxproc' each specify limit (on memory and number of
processes). If that limit is exceeded, application is
killed. Memory limit is expressed in megabytes. Default values
are 100 megabytes and 50 processes allowed.</p>

Example:
<pre>
--trick=DoS:maxmem=100;maxproc=50
</pre>

<p>This is tricky. We do not want to duplicate kernel's memory
metering, and we do not want to ask kernel how much memory
applications occupy after each change. Therefore, we do
tricks: we maintain variable grace, and try to somehow compute
how much memory in worst case processes could consume. If it
is below grace, we lower grace and just let process
allocate. If not, we do full recomputation and set grace back
to some value.</p>

<p>mmap and brk operations are pretty common, still need to be
watched by this trick. That means that slowdown from this
trick is big.</p>


<h2>FixFlashTrick</h2>
<p>This works around a bug in the Macromedia Flash plugin which will
cause Netscape to hang when a Flash object is encountered but /dev/dsp
cannot be opened (because it's in use, perhaps by esd).  Access will
fail (and there will be no Flash sound).</p>


<h2>GoodDiscTrick</h2>
<p>Unknown</p>


<h2>GuessPasswordTrick</h2>
<p>This is exceedingly lame, but sometimes I forget the exact spelling of a
password I haven't used in a long time.  It's pretty easy to whip up a
little script (see example) to cycle through all the combinations, but some
programs only take passwords from /dev/tty, making them hard to script.
This trick does the stuffing.</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
for i in I i; do
    for o in o 0; do
        for p in '' . '?'; do
sf --tri=GuessPassword":guess='${i}s that my passw${o}rd${p}\n'" pgp -d /tmp/foo.pgp
        done
    done
done
</pre>


<h2>NetFailTrick</h2>
<p>Causes calls to connect to fail with error EHOSTUNREACH, and calls to
listen to fail with EOPNOTSUPP.</p>



<h2>NetThrottleTrick</h2>
<p>Limit network bandwidth usage, by delaying network I/O calls.  This
trick has a Gtk GUI to allow interactive control of the bandwidth
limit.  An optional parameter 'bps' sets the initial limit, in bytes
per second.</p>

<p>If the GUI is closed by the user (or should crash), the application
will continue with the last set limit.  If the limit was 0, however,
it will be reset to unlimited (rather than leaving the application
hung).</p>



<h2>NetTrick</h2>
<p>Restricts network access.</p>

<p>Anyway, you can now filter network access in term of what
addresses are passed and where. You can pass filter=['-TCP 195\.113.*']
to dissallow any connections to 195.113 network. (Notice that passed
value is regexp and that it is allow/deny trick. [I know that
using regexps for network matching is not ideal, but you'll probably
want to limit to a small set of machines, anyway, so it should not hurt
much.]</p>

<p>Notice that connect and bind is not separated. It probably should be.</p>
							

<h2>NoClose123Trick</h2>
<p>Do not let processes close fd 123.  (see Scratch trick)</p>



<h2>NoKillTrick</h2>
<p>Do not let traced processes to kill outside sandbox. Do not
allow them to use ptrace(), since ptrace() does not work inside
sandbox, and could be used to do anything outside sandbox.</p>

<p>Unless kernel goes _really_ crazy (like an out-of-memory situation)
and kills process without telling us (which just should not happen),
this is safe.  Process can not go away before we are notified,
therefore there are no races with pids wrapping around.</p>
			


<h2>NoMunmapTrick</h2>
<p>Does not let traced process play with force-mmaped memory from scratch module.</p>

<p>Alternatively, pass start and end addresses of memory you
don't want processes to play with.</p>




<h2>ParanoiaTrick</h2>
<p>This trick is truly paranoid: it denies all syscalls it does
not know because they might be potentially harmfull.</p>


<h2>PathSandboxTrick</h2>
<p>Restricts filesystem access to paths specified by config file.</p>
	
<p>Format of config file is as follows:</p>
<pre>
path {allow, deny, allow_if_public} {read,write,ask} path
</pre>
<p>You are allowed to create lines like this:</p>
<pre>			
path alllow_if_public read /
path allow read,write /dev/tty
</pre>

<p>On each operation, config is scanned from the beggining to the
end. If path from config is start of current path,
access is allowed or denied, and no further processing is
done. Allow_if_public means that sandbox looks at access mode
of given object. If is not readable for everyone, file is scanned further
, otherwise access is allowed.</p>

<p>Notice that allow_if_public is slightly dangerous:</p>

<pre>
application: open /foo/bar
subterfugue: checks that /foo/bar is readable from other thread
you: rm /foo/bar; umask 700; echo "secret data" > /foo/bar
subterfugue: allows access to /foo/bar
</pre>

<p>Solution is not using allow_if_public. (Unfortunately,
allow_if_public that said "denied" on non-existant files is
not terribly usefull: applications like to open non-existant
files for example when they search path.)<p>

<p>names like this. [Notice that if you did chmod instead of
rm&umask, you'd be in danger even without subterfugue.]</p>

<p>If you add "allow ask /" line into config file, then "denied"
accesses are not really denied, but user is prompted whether
or not he really wants to perform given operation.</p>

<p>This syntax should be compatible with syntax used in janus.</p>


<h2>Rot13Trick</h2>
<p>Does a rot13 translation on all output done with the 'write' syscall.</p>


<h2>ScratchTrick</h2>
<p>Provides a safe copy area for arguments.</p>

<p>This trick should be as innermost (rightmost) as possible.</p>

<p>Notice that without this trick, and appropriate tricks to
actually copy arguments (ArgTrick), traced applications may play nasty
games with volatile memory, resulting in TraceTrick lying,
SimplePathSandbox not being effective, etc. However,
application would have to deliberately play races and in case of
application being nasty of purpose you have to be very cautious.</p>


<h2>SignalTrick</h2>
<p>Ignore or map signals</p>


<h2>SimplePathSandboxTrick</h2>
<p>Restricts filesystem access to specified paths.  The parameters 'read'
and 'write' each specify a list of paths; for each path, access will
be given to the file or directory tree specified.</p>

Examples:
<pre>
--trick=SimplePathSandbox:read=['/'];write=['.']
#Limit read and write ability
sf --trick=SimplePathSandbox:"read=['/'];write=['/dev/tty']" bash
</pre>

<p>(Note that '~' is not interpreted specially.)</p>

<p>Each path can be prefixed by a '-' to indicated that access to the
path should be denied.  This example would allow '/home' to be read,
but not anything under '/home/pavel'.</p>

Example:
<pre>
--trick=SimplePathSandbox:read=['-/home/pavel','/home']
</pre>

<p>The first applicable path determines whether or not access is
allowed.  If no path is applicable, access is denied.</p>

<p>A diagnostic will be output each time an action is denied unless the
'quiet' parameter is set to a true value.</p>

<p>Network access will be blocked unless the parameter 'net' is 1; if it
is, access to all Unix domain sockets will be possible, even if not
allowed by the 'read' or 'write' list (yes, this is a wart).</p>

<p>(This trick blocks the rarely used 'quotactl' and 'nfsservctl' calls,
which are tricky to handle correctly.)</p>
	

<h2>StdioTrick</h2>
<p>This trick is truly paranoid: it denies all syscalls it does
not know because they might do something wrong.</p>

<p>Code here is very ugly: we want to want even on unpatched
2.2.X. Unpatched 2.2.X can not deny syscall, so we at least
patch all arguments to zeros on syscall being denied.  This
could be circumvented if RAM was mapped on page 0; therefore
you should use NoMunmapTrick to prevent messing with page 0.</p>


<h2>ThrottleIOTrick</h2>
<p>Delays read and write calls so that the average I/O rate (via these
calls) is limited.  The 'bps' parameter is required and is the I/O
limit, in bytes per second.</p>


<h2>ThrottleReadIOTrick</h2>
<p>Delays read calls so that the average I/O rate (via these calls) is
limited.  The 'bps' parameter is required and is the I/O limit, in
bytes per second.</p>


<h2>TimeWarpTrick</h2>
<p>Warp time to adjust the time considered to be "now" and/or to run
slower or faster than true elapsed time. </p>

<p>The float parameter 'delta' adjusts "now" relatively.  So, for
example, a delta of -10.5 would cause gettimeofday to return a time
ten and a half seconds earlier than the true time.</p>

<p>The float parameter 'now' adjusts "now" absolutely.  It is an absolute
count of seconds since the epoch.  Such values can be had from the
date command, like so</p>

<pre>
--tri=TimeWarp:now=$(date --date='May 7' +%s)
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
--tri=TimeWarp:now=$(date --date='one week ago' +%s)
</pre>

<p>The float parameter 'w' is the warp factor.  A factor of 1.0
corresponds to normal execution.  A factor of 2.0 will make time pass
at twice normal speed for the program; to you, it will seem to run
"faster" (e.g., sleep(2) will actually sleep half as long, time(2)
will return greater than normal value, etc.)  The factor may be less
than 1.0 to make time pass more slowly.  It must be greater than 0.</p>

<p>Warp factors below 1 will probably be better tolerated by the
application.</p>

<p>(Keep in mind that SUBTERFUGUE itself makes programs run somewhat
slower, so the warp factors are relative.)</p>

<p>Any or all options can be combined.</p>
								
<pre>
#Clock runs slow
sf --trick=TimeWarp:w=0.1 xclock &

#Clock runs fast
sf --trick=TimeWarp:w=100 xclock &

#Run command in the past
sf --trick=TimeWarp:now=$(date --date='1 hour ago' +%s) xclock &
sf --trick=TimeWarp:now=$(date --date='2 hours ago' +%s) xclock &

sf --trick=TimeWarp:now=$(date --date='1 week ago' +%s) xclock &
sf --trick=TimeWarp:now=$(date --date='4 weeks ago' +%s) xclock &
</pre>								


<h2>TraceTrick</h2>
<p>Traces system calls, signals, and process exit (similar to strace(1)).
The 'call' parameter may specify a list of system call names; in this
case, calls not in the list will not be traced.</p>

<pre>
#Trace app
sf --trick=Trace date
</pre>

<h2>UmaskTrick</h2>
<p>Forces sandboxed application not to use certain file
permissions.  For example does not allow apps to use setuid bit.</p>
